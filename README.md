This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, Clone the Repository
Before running the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lavanyapetchetti/tech-interview.git
cd tech-interview/timezone-app
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing

To run tests, ensure that the development server is running in background. Then, run `npm run e2e` or `yarn e2e` to execute tests. If this is your first time running Playwright tests, you should run `npx playwright install` or `yarn playwright install` to install browser binaries.

```
npx playwright install
npm run e2e
```
